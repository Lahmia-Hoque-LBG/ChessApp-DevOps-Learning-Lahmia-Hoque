Feature: Knight Movement
  As a player
  I want my knight to move in L-shaped patterns
  So that I can use its unique mobility during gameplay

  Scenario: Valid knight movement (two forward, one left)
    Given the chess board is set up
    And a knight is on g1
    When the player moves the knight from g1 to f3
    Then the knight should be at f3
    And g1 should be empty

  Scenario: Valid knight movement (one forward, two right)
    Given the chess board is set up
    And a knight is on b8
    When the player moves the knight from b8 to c6
    Then the knight should be at c6
    And b8 should be empty

  Scenario: Knight captures an opponent piece
    Given the chess board is set up
    And a knight is on e5
    And an opponentâ€™s bishop is on d7
    When the player moves the knight from e5 to d7
    Then the bishop should be captured
    And the knight should be at d7

  Scenario: Invalid knight movement (straight forward)
    Given the chess board is set up
    And a knight is on g1
    When the player tries to move the knight from g1 to g2
    Then the move should be rejected
    And the knight should remain at g1
