  I want my rook to move horizontally and vertically
  So that I can control open files and ranks

  Scenario: Valid vertical movement
    Given the chess board is set up
    And a rook is on a1
    When the player moves the rook from a1 to a4
    Then the rook should be at a4
    And a1 should be empty

    Given the chess board is set up
    And a rook is on c1
    And an opponentâ€™s knight is on c7
    When the player moves the rook from c1 to c7
    Then the knight should be captured
    And the rook should be at c7

  Scenario: Invalid diagonal move
    Given the chess board is set up
    And a rook is on h1
