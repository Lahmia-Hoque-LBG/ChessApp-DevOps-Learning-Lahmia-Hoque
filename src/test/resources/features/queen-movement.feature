  I want my queen to move in any straight line
  So that I can control the board and capture strategically

  Scenario: Valid vertical movement

    And a queen is on d1
    When the player moves the queen from d1 to d5
    Then the queen should be at d5
    And d1 should be empty

  Scenario: Valid horizontal movement
    Given the chess board is set up
    And a queen is on d5
