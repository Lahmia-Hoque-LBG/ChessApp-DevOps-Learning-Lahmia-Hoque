Feature: Bishop Movement
  As a player
  I want my bishop to move diagonally on the chess board
  So that I can control long-range squares and capture strategically

  Scenario: Valid diagonal movement
    Given the chess board is set up
    And a bishop is on c1
    When the player moves the bishop from c1 to f4
    Then the bishop should be at f4
    And c1 should be empty

  Scenario: Bishop captures an opponent piece diagonally
    Given the chess board is set up
    And a bishop is on f4
    And an opponentâ€™s knight is on h6
    When the player moves the bishop from f4 to h6
    Then the knight should be captured
    And the bishop should be at h6

  Scenario: Invalid bishop movement (non-diagonal)
    Given the chess board is set up
    And a bishop is on c1
    When the player tries to move the bishop from c1 to c3
    Then the move should be rejected
    And the bishop should remain at c1

  Scenario: Bishop cannot jump over pieces
    Given the chess board is set up
    And a bishop is on c1
    And a pawn is on d2
    When the player tries to move the bishop from c1 to e3
    Then the move should be rejected
    And the bishop should remain at c1

  Scenario: Bishop moves along long diagonal
    Given the chess board is set up
    And a bishop is on a1
    And all squares along the a1-h8 diagonal are empty
    When the player moves the bishop from a1 to h8
    Then the bishop should be at h8
    And a1 should be empty
